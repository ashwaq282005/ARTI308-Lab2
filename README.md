Machine Learning Problem:
This problem focuses on a classification task where the goal is to identify the strength of passwords. The task is to classify passwords into different categories (Strong, Weak, or Other) based on their characteristics such as length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This is a supervised learning problem using multi-class classification.

Dataset: An open-source Password Strength Dataset from Kaggle was used to solve this challenge. Along with extracted features like password length and the presence of uppercase, lowercase, and unusual characters, it includes 10,000 distinct passwords. The dataset is appropriate for a password strength classification problem because each password is assigned a strength category.
